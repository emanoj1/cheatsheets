### WHAT IS THIS
As a coding newbie, I am often overwhelmed by the amount of information that hits me - some I retain, some I ignore, some I use and other's I missed! I felt a cheatsheet with the most common commands or techniques for solving a problem could be handy for my quick reference. Everyone knows the power of cheatsheets, and I am hoping this little effort will help me, and perhaps you also!

### UPDATES
This is a work in progress.

As I study and come across info that I think requires a cheatsheet, I shall prepare it here. I may also include cheatsheets created by others here with full attribution.
